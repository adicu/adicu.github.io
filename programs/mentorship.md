# Mentorship
## Helping make CS more inclusive

The CS Mentorship Program is a student initiative that pairs first-years and sophomores interested in majoring in CS with juniors and seniors currently studying it. Join us for a semester of creating long-term relationships between mentors and mentees, community events (with free food!) and mentor-led internal workshops about specific topics within CS.
It is a great opportunity to give back to the CS community, gain experience leading a workshop, and meet fellow upperclassmen in CS. Workshops and informative events will take place Tuesday evenings and bonding activities Friday afternoons, so you should expect to have these times open.
