# Labs
## Build apps for the Columbia community.

### About 
ADI Labs is your opportunity to apply what you learn in class to real-life projects meant to help the Columbia community. Through Labs, you’ll work on existing projects (i.e. Density or the Jupyter notebook), learn how to work with existing codebases already in production, and get to learn best practices for both software engineering and UI/UX design. Certain projects may be eligible for course credit as well.

As a member of Labs, you’ll learn to contribute to open source projects and to take your programming beyond problem sets. Paired with one of our student mentors, you’ll learn software engineering techniques used in industry. You’ll also join an awesome community of builders that love to bring ideas to life and have a great time doing so.
Applications for Spring 2018 are currently closed. Fall 2018 applications will be open during April 2018.

### What we offer
- Thoughtful Mentorship
What does good mentorship mean? To us, it means creating a safe environment for everyone to learn while challenging you to learn new skills and to think differently. We aim to create a learning environment inclusive to people of all backgrounds.

- Learning by Doing
While classes are great, they’re no substitute for real world experience. ADI Labs is all about hands-on experience, working with real products that people already use.

- A Community of Driven People
Labs is a community of motivated individuals that are not here to just fool around. They are here to learn how to build and contribute to the greater tech community.
