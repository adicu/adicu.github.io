# Startup Career Fair 
## Connecting students and startups

### About
Interested in getting a job or internship at a startup? Join ADI at our 6th annual Startup Career Fair to meet some of the most exciting tech startups around—and make sure to bring a resume! Last year over 550 Columbia students met 14 tech startups. This year it's going to be even better. Engineers will tell you about what it's like to work at a tech startup, and can give you tips for how to interview and get a job!

The Fall 2018 Startup Career Fair is TBD.
